Heart Attack Classification by Team 4 [Divya Kona, Prathama S Bharadwaj, Sai Bindhu G, Sanjana J Bharadwaj]
The project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning to identify individuals at high risk of heart attacks. Utilizing historical health data, the model will analyze key risk factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate to predict heart attack likelihood. The goal is to assist healthcare providers in early detection and proactive management, ultimately reducing heart attack incidences and improving patient outcomes.
